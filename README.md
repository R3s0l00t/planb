Working on finding alternative ways to use the internet, from open source software to browing behaviour up to messagin, social networking. How can we use the net daily and also help without having to re-invent the circle ?  Can we use the idle state of our computer, 
smartphone to give others ressources for calculation power ?  Can we help by using a special shopping site to help those in need ?  Is there a search engine that contributes to environmental help while we search the web ? 

Most of those questions can be answered with a yes.  But our daily routines and habits are so hardened that we often won't even look for alternatives. Why would we ?  Our current routines work just fine.
But what if I tell you that some urls and tools might not demand you to change your habits in a "hard way". And if the large mass starts using those tools - we can make a change.

We are the 99%. 

We decide how things proceed - by our daily habits and behaviours.

I'll update this page on a regular base and try to cover as much "genres" as possible to show you alternatives for most daily usage.
